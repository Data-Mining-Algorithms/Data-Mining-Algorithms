# Data-Mining-Algorithms

## Overview
This project was developed for the Data Mining module at Teesside University with the aim to           
demonstrate and evaluate the use of popular computational techniques for data mining. The                 
project contains implementations of popular Data Mining techniques such as Dimension Reduction,
Association Rules Mining, Collaborative Filtering and a variety of data sets to test on.
